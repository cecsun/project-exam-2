# Holidaze – An Accommodation Booking Site

A front-end web application for a newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze. The site allows visitors to browse and search venues, customers to book stays, and venue managers to create and manage venues.
## Description

Holidaze is a fully responsive web application developed with React as the final project of my course. It showcases my skills in planning, designing, and building a modern front-end using current industry standards and tools. The application interacts with a REST API to handle live data and supports two types of users: customers and venue managers. This project brings together the knowledge and experience I’ve gained over the past two years in web development, design, and deployment workflows.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

* Node.js (>=v20.11 recommended)
* npm (>=v10.2.4+)
* React (>=19)
* Bootstrap (>=5.3.5)
* OS: Windows / macOS / Linux

### Installing

#### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/cecsun/project-exam-2.git
cd project-exam-2
```

#### Install dependencies:

```npm install```

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the API base URL:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY='replace with key'`

#### Executing Program

##### To run the development server:

`npm run start`

The app will be available locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

##### To build for production:

`npm run build`


### Help

* If API calls fail, ensure the .env file is configured correctly and the API server is available.
* Clear the browser cache or disable browser extensions that might interfere with CORS.
* For general issues, delete `node_modules` directory and reinstall dependencies with `npm install`:
